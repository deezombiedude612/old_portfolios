					This took place when I was still studying in Methodist College Kuala Lumpur (MCKL). During that
					time, the college had decided that it would be made compulsory for everyone starting from my intake
					onwards, being the January 2014 Intake, to take the MPW modules (Character Formation and Service
					Learning). I had only spent a semester in MCKL, but during that time I was able to complete the
					Service Learning module. The module requires us to commit 20 hours to community service at one of
					MCKL’s service learning partner organisations to be selected by each group, giving us a variety of
					choices of what to commit to the organisation of our choice. We were then supposed to keep a log of
					every activity we carried out during that time and report to the lecturer in-charge, Ms Rachel
					Chua, to keep track on our progress.
				</p>
				<p>
					My team comprised of Chau Ting Feng, Cheong Hsien Hwa, Teo Lee Hong and myself, all from the 1401D
					cohort. We chose to go to the El-Shaddai Refugee Learning Centre (ESRLC). For those of you who do
					not know what it is, it is an organisation that takes in refugees of all kinds and provides basic
					necessities and shelter for them. As for the refugee children, they were also given education up to
					that of a primary school leaver standard. They currently depend on partnering churches for
					donations in the form of cash and food items. My team was able to contribute to the organisation by
					settling the book catalog in the library, but the most effort was put to work in the backyard
					garden, which was meant to teach the refugee children the importance of responsibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					It seemed as though I was the most enthusiastic one in visiting the ESRLC centre every time,
					whereas the others did not seem to get what they intended to do in the first place. However, we
					were able to resolve most problems together and managed to foster teamwork throughout this period
					of serving in ESRLC. The people in charge there were very kind to redirect us to anything that they
					need help with. By the end of the session, we were able to view the fruits of our labor; the book
					catalog was finally settled, and the garden was transformed from nothing but dust to a very healthy
					vegetation garden. The satisfaction we got was just sensational. Nothing could replace such
					experience, and on a personal note, that was one of the best experiences I had ever gone through
					upon stepping into MCKL. My teammates and I will never forget the time spent on the “Sukuru Report”
					(a name we gave to our final reports), but more importantly, we are and will always be the ESRLC
					Rookie Helpers!!!
