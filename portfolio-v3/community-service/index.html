									Having done another community service initiative project before does not really mean
									that joining yet another will provide the same experience. However, that did mean
									that I got to enjoy works like these just as how I enjoyed my last one three years
									prior; had you been there during our first briefing session you could easily tell
									that I was really eager to get started.
								</p>
								<p>
									There were a few differences I had to take note as my take-away from the first
									briefing: firstly, as Computing students our aim is not to do anything like clean
									houses or any of the regular activities one would normally come up with when
									visiting an orphanage or old folks home. Apparently, it is our job to actually find
									a way to use what we have learnt throughout our time studying as a Computing student
									and apply that in helping society, the bare minimum being basic IT education I
									guess.
								</p>
								<p>
									My class soon grouped ourselves into groups of 6-7 people. I ended up having six
									classmates whom I know pretty well, but probably not or barely worked on any
									assignments together previously prior: Chiew King Chan, Jie Li, Marcus Loke, Syamimi
									Suhaidi, Nisa Angelina, and Mwale Ntambo. After a few phone calls, King managed to
									secure a location we can go to carry out our community service works. Basically,
									yeah.. that's how we got to go to Good Samaritan Home, located all the way in Klang.
									(Wow, second time and I'm still going over to Klang.)
								</p>
								<p>
									The team and I had a few meetings together to brainstorm on what we can do to
									complete our 10-hour requirement, and it had to be done in multiple sessions and not
									just doing it all in one shot. As the only one who had actually done a community
									service project initiative before in the team, I was tasked as team lead to help
									share any ideas I may have given my previous experience. It eventually turns out I
									did not need to do much more than anyone else; everyone was giving their all to our
									activities which were split into 5 two-hour sessions, the first two of which were
									done on the same day itself.
								</p>
								<p>
									Come the days when we went over to the home, we had a few accounts of experience,
									fun and.. uh, not so good #SHTUFF of our own. Our ice-breaking activity (Activity 1)
									did not turn out so well as we had expected. Our initial idea was to get the
									children to visualize and draw out what they think a computer of the future would
									look like. It turns out that they did not have a slight clue as to how modern
									technology has advanced so far apart from games and the occasional big names of
									famous products; some literally had nothing come to mind and started drawing
									something else or fold paper airplanes! The original plan would have ended with us
									giving a small prize to those whom we think showed the most creativity after giving
									them an hour or so to carry out what we got them to do. Upon finishing the activity,
									we had ample time left and despite having not planned this at all, we proceeded with
									starting to bond with the cheeky children. Honestly, most of them were just not shy
									at all. They loved playing and interacting with us; hyperactive, always smiling,
									that sort of thing.. and we really loved those prominent aspects of their character.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our fun experiences just continued throughout Activities 2 to 4, where we got them
									to learn how to use Gmail and Microsoft Office Powerpoint, as well as a small talk
									on Internet Privacy. We got the green light for the kids to get an e-mail account
									from the PIC (YM Tay), and initially we told the kids that having an e-mail account
									would mean being able to contact friends for like homework or something important.
									They soon find out that they were allowed to attach pictures in the e-mails they
									send and from that point, they were sending funny GIFs to each other. The third
									activity was albeit uneventful, since all we are doing is just teaching them how to
									make their slides look more creative. The fourth activity, however, ended with
									pretty hilarious results. While some of us attempted to pose as scheming baddies
									trying to rip off information from the kids, how some of them responded to those
									messages within a small chat group as an alternative to social media accounts turned
									out to be completely unexpected and BONKERS. Oh well, at least they knew that they
									are not supposed to post any vital or private information online.. I think.
								</p>
								<p>
									We were told by the PIC to give them a small little test to see whether what we
									tried to teach them was fruitful or not, and we did exactly that for Activity 5..
									and they did turn out to be paying attention and keeping to heart what had been done
									for them throughout the activities. We ended the session, truly sad that our time we
									had with the kids came to an end, but happy that we managed to spend time with them
									and got to share some basic IT knowledge with them. There was a promise we made,
									saying that we would return one day. I'm just hoping we keep that promise, all the
									more when our chances of seeing them as a group get slimmer.

									This took place when I was still studying in Methodist College Kuala Lumpur (MCKL).
									During that time, the college had decided that it would be made compulsory for
									everyone starting from my intake onwards, being the January 2014 Intake, to take the
									MPW modules (Character Formation and Service Learning). I had only spent a semester
									in MCKL, but during that time I was able to complete the Service Learning module.
									The module requires us to commit 20 hours to community service at one of MCKL’s
									service learning partner organisations to be selected by each group, giving us a
									variety of choices of what to commit to the organisation of our choice. We were then
									supposed to keep a log of every activity we carried out during that time and report
									to the lecturer in-charge, Ms Rachel Chua, to keep track on our progress.
								</p>
								<p>
									My team comprised of Chau Ting Feng, Cheong Hsien Hwa, Teo Lee Hong and myself, all
									from the 1401D cohort. We chose to go to the El-Shaddai Refugee Learning Centre
									(ESRLC). For those of you who do not know what it is, it is an organisation that
									takes in refugees of all kinds and provides basic necessities and shelter for them.
									As for the refugee children, they were also given education up to that of a primary
									school leaver standard. They currently depend on partnering churches for donations
									in the form of cash and food items. My team was able to contribute to the
									organisation by settling the book catalog in the library, but the most effort was
									put to work in the backyard garden, which was meant to teach the refugee children
									the importance of responsibility.
								</p>
								<p>
									It seemed as though I was the most enthusiastic one in visiting the ESRLC centre
									every time, whereas the others did not seem to get what they intended to do in the
									first place. However, we were able to resolve most problems together and managed to
									foster teamwork throughout this period of serving in ESRLC. The people in charge
									there were very kind to redirect us to anything that they need help with. By the end
									of the session, we were able to view the fruits of our labor; the book catalog was
									finally settled, and the garden was transformed from nothing but dust to a very
									healthy vegetation garden. The satisfaction we got was just sensational. Nothing
									could replace such experience, and on a personal note, that was one of the best
									experiences I had ever gone through upon stepping into MCKL. My teammates and I will
									never forget the time spent on the “Sukuru Report” (a name we gave to our final
									reports), but more importantly, we are and will always be the ESRLC Rookie
									Helpers!!!
